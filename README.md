# exposure-of-refugee-camps
How exposed are refugee camps to various climatic shocks and stresses?

## Background
This repository contains the data and the code behind the PNAS publication "Refugee settlements are highly exposed to extreme weather conditions." 

## Data
We used two types of data sets in this study: **climate** and **population.** Let's us briefly explain what are the data sets and how you can download them. 

We downloaded the climate data from the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home)(CDS) by Copernicus Climate Change Service. We used two data sets: [ERA5-Land monthly averaged](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means?tab=form) and [Agroclimatic indicators](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-agroclimatic-indicators?tab=form). If you would like to download the data yourself, please, request an API from  the CDS. After you got it, you may re-use code from the `get-climate-grid.ipynb` to download it.

You can download most of the data sets with the use of `get-climate-grid` and `get-population-grid`. Also, we stored the raw and processed data on the [4TU.ResearchData](https://figshare.com/s/86e5a5d5c4bd206a25c7).
