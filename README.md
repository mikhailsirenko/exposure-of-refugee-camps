# exposure-of-refugee-camps
How exposed are refugee camps to various climatic shocks and stresses?

## Background
This repository contains the data and the code behind the PNAS publication "Refugee settlements are highly exposed to extreme weather conditions." 

## Data
We used two types of data sets in this study: **Climate** and **Population.** 

We downloaded the climate date from the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) by Copernicus Climate Change Service. The data sets are: [ERA5-Land monthly averaged](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means?tab=form) and [Agroclimatic indicators](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-agroclimatic-indicators?tab=form)

You can download most of the data sets with the use of `get-climate-grid` and `get-population-grid`. Also, we stored the raw and processed data on the [4TU.ResearchData](https://figshare.com/s/86e5a5d5c4bd206a25c7).
