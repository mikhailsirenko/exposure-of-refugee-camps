# exposure-of-refugee-camps
How exposed are refugee camps to various climatic shocks and stresses?

## Background
This repository contains the data and the code behind the PNAS publication "Refugee settlements are highly exposed to extreme weather conditions." 

## Data
We used two types of **open** data sets in this study: **climate** and **population.** Let's us briefly explain what are the data sets and how you can download them.

The climate data comes from the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) (CDS) by Copernicus Climate Change Service and the two data sets are:
* [ERA5-Land monthly averaged](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means?tab=form),
* [Agroclimatic indicators](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-agroclimatic-indicators?tab=form).

The population data or Population Counts comes from [WorldPop](https://hub.worldpop.org/) (you can download versions of this data via other sources as well, e.g. [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/worldpop-population-counts-for-world/resource/677d30ab-896e-44e5-9a31-05452bc3124b)):
* [Unconstrained global mosaics 2020 (1km resolution)](https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/summary?id=24777).

You can download or process most of the data sets with the use of `get-climate-grid` and `get-population-grid`. You can find the raw and processed data on the [4TU.ResearchData](https://figshare.com/s/86e5a5d5c4bd206a25c7).
