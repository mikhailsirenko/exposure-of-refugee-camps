# exposure-refugee-camps
How exposed are refugee camps to various climatic shocks and stresses?

## Intro
This repository contains the data and the code behind PNAS publication 'Refugee settlements are highly exposed to extreme weather conditions." 

## Data
You can download most of the data sets with the use of `get-climate-grid` and `get-population-grid`. Also, we stored the data on the [4TU.ResearchData](https://figshare.com/s/86e5a5d5c4bd206a25c7).
